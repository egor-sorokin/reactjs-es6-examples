## How to run the project:
Make a clone of this repository or download ZIP, then:

 ```sh
$ cd [project-dir]
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
And go to http://localhost:3333/ in your browser

### Change default port
By default, the project will use port 3333. If you need you can change it:
```sh

```
Then open the file *webpack.config.js* and change line 9 (port: 3333)

## Tasks and themes
Here I covered some themes and did some tasks related to ReactJS and ECMAScript6. 
Key words: 
 - ECMAScript6 syntax
 - Routing
 - Animations (on scroll, ReactCSSTransitionGroup)
 - Carousel/Slider for pictures
 - To do list with Flux
